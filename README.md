# Portfolio

This is a basic portfolio site built using Rails 4.0.2 and Zurb Foundation 5.

Current features include a Posts page, and a Projects listing page.

### Author:  Doug MacDowell

### Installation

TBD - *This is a work in progress for a college programming class.*

## Usage

The main page now has enhanced formatting, including a title bar with nav buttons.

The __Check Postings__ button will take you to the Posts page.

The __Projects__ button takes you to the listing of fictitious projects. From there, new projects can be added, and existing projects can be edited or deleted.
